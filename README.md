# BSTSearch
## Implement a C program to construct a Binary Search Tree, to search for an element in BST and to display the elements in the tree using Inorder traversals.     Binary Search tree is a binary tree in which each internal node x stores an element such that the element stored in the left subtree of x are less than or equal to x and elements stored in the right subtree of x are greater than or equal to x. This is called binary-search-tree property.      

## Input and Output Format:  Refer Sample Input and Output for formatting specifications.        
### Sample Input and Output 1:  </br> 
Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  1 </br>
Do you want to insert another element?  yes  </br>
Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  2  </br>
Do you want to insert another element?  yes  </br>
Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  3  </br>
Do you want to insert another element?  yes  </br>
Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  4  </br>
Do you want to insert another element?  no </br> 
Inorder Traversal : The elements in the tree are 1 2 3 4  </br>
Enter the element to be searched  6  </br>
6 not found     
</br>
</br>
### Sample Input and Output 2:  </br>
Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  1  </br>
Do you want to insert another element?  yes  </br>
Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  2  </br>
Do you want to insert another element?  yes  </br>
Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  3  </br>
Do you want to insert another element?  yes  </br>
Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  3  </br>
Do you want to insert another element?  no  </br>
Inorder Traversal : The elements in the tree are 1 2 3 4  </br>
Enter the element to be searched  3  </br>
3 found
